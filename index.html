            <h2 class="sec__title">Every idea <img src="./assets/img/idea.png" alt="Lightbulb"> starts with a need</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>

                    <h3> <img src="./assets/img/title02.svg" alt="Lightbulb"> Start with asking why</h3>You will start
                    seeing things differently and coming up with more
                    effective ways of achieving goals.

                    looking at problems from a different perspective, your
                    ideas will be fresher and more valuable.

                    <h3> <img src="./assets/img/title01.svg" alt="Heart"> Design solutions with love</h3>Only when you
                    experience a problem yourself do you understand the
                    frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

                    <h3> <img src="./assets/img/title03.svg" alt="Pencil"> Share and show your work </h3>As designers,
                    we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
                    finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
